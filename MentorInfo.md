## Rules & Guidelines

1.  You cannot work with the kids unless you’ve been fingerprinted for your background check.
    
2.  You must have signed the anti-harassment form.
    
3.  Do not touch the kids.
    
4.  Do not be alone with the kids.
    
5.  Please wear your Code For Fun shirts. This makes us look more professional and helps the kids find us. You should also pick up your badge from the front desk. (Return it after the session, we keep them for you.)
    

## Mentor Group Assignments

You can see which group you’re assigned to on Trello. Group assignments are flexible and can change at any time depending on number of students in each section. We have far more Python material than Javascript so Javascript mentors are most likely to be moved.

## First Time Students

1.) Help them set up Intra

2.) Help them set up Slack

## How to set up Intra (Computer Password is same)

Students should get an email with their intra username. It often ends up in their Junk/Spam folder. They can change the password on their phone or a mentor’s computer.

1.  They will need to set their password at [http://intra.42.fr](http://intra.42.fr/)
    

       a. Click “Forgot or Change Password”
    
    b. Enter their username, not their email. Password rules: 12 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. The only special characters allowed are `~@*_.-+:{}[]` and you cannot put two special characters together at the end.
    

3.  It’s a great idea for mentors to show students how the intra works. Cover:
    

    a.  As you do projects, you’ll see you level up here.
    
    b.  Show them the Holy Graph
    
    c.  Click on the first project from there and click top right to bring them to their project page
    
    d.  Show them they can register for a project
    
    e.  Show them where the instructions/pdfs/resources are
    
    f.  Encourage them to ask their peers and mentors questions if they aren’t sure how to move forward. As mentors we need to help them more than regular 42 cadets, so do try to explain it to them. You can save some time by explaining intra to them as a group gathered around one person’s computer or their own if they are all there.
    
## How to join Slack

All mentors and H2S students should be on Slack.

### Mentors:

1.  Go to [https://h2s42.slack.com](https://h2s42.slack.com/)
    
2.  Setup an account using intrausername@student.42.us.org
    
3.  Make sure you’re in #mentors. Message Jem or Sangita to be added if needed. This channel is shared with parent and student volunteers as well.
    
4.  Change your username to Mentor - Your Name
    
5.  Upload a slack photo of yourself to help the kids find you more easily. You can use Photobooth on the Mac computers to take a picture.
    

     a. Photobooth Troubleshooting - Sometimes you need to close Photobooth and reopen it. The 2nd time it opens it will prompt you to create a folder to save your photos into. Then it should work. For easy access you can just drag the photo from the slideshow bar onto the desktop.
    

  

###  Students:

1.  Go to [https://h2s42.slack.com](https://h2s42.slack.com/)
    
2.  Setup an account using [intrausername@student.42.us.org](mailto:intrausername@student.42.us.org)
    
3.  Per #announcements, students should take a photo of themselves and post it in the #introductions channel. They should also set this to be their Slack photo. (Admin will use this to set their Intra photo)

## Check-in computers  
1.) Please do not use these computers without permission.

2.) These computers do not count hours towards intra.

3.) Please don’t upgrade/update the computers, it can take a fair bit of time to get them set up correctly. If you are in charge of Check-in Sangita will give you access to the appropriate Google Sheet / Google Drive.  
  
Check-in computers have InsomniaX installed on the desktop. You can use this to keep the computers from going to sleep. Computers that go to sleep require time to boot back up -- this can be a big problem when we’re handling a large line of people.

## Being a good mentor

1.  Enforce the rules
    

    a.  No drinks on desks -- put them on the floor.
    
    b.  No food at the computers. They can eat at the couches in the middle of the lab where we can see them.
    

2.  Email the parents at regular intervals. (More info coming soon.)
